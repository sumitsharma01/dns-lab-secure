# dns-lab-secure
A hands-on project to build a secure DNS server in a virtual lab. Explore DNS fundamentals, simulate real-world attacks like spoofing and cache poisoning, and apply security hardening techniques. Learn TCP/IP, OSI layer communication, and gain practical cybersecurity skills.


# Secure DNS Lab 🔐🌐

## Overview

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a foundational component of the internet — translating human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into machine-understandable IP addresses (like `93.184.216.34`). However, DNS is also a major attack surface in cybersecurity.

This project explores:
- Building a **small-scale DNS server** inside a virtual environment.
- Analyzing and simulating **DNS-based attacks**.
- **Hardening** the DNS server against such attacks.
- Along with the project, we will also be Learning the **TCP/IP model**, **OSI layers**, and **communication between hosts** in real-world networking environments.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Build a functioning DNS server in a virtual lab setup.
- Research and simulate known DNS attacks (e.g., spoofing, cache poisoning, amplification).
- Explore and implement security best practices and hardening techniques.
- Visualize and explain communication across **TCP/IP and OSI models**.
